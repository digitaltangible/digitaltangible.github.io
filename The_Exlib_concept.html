                        <br>

                        <p>Having a book in your hands is not only about accessing the content, it´s also an aesthetic experience: we value 
						a beautiful binding, the warmth of the paper and many other things that makes a book an object with charm. We would like 
						to keep part of that charm with our Seebooks. For technology not to make us give up the beautiful arts a book embodies, we have 
						created the ExLib concept.</p>

                        <p>Our ExLib is the picture you will see inside our Seebooks. It carries the serial number of the card and the codes 
						you will need to download the content. </p>
                        <br>

                        <div class="text-center">
                            <img src="img/ExLibdefconQR.jpg" alt="Title">
                        </div>
                        <br><br>

                        <p>It is a tribute to one of the classic elements of the bibliophile: <i>ex
                            libris </i>is a Latin phrase meaning 'from the books'. Formerly every good reader had his particular ex libris
							designed and printed with his name. He used to paste it in the first page of a book as a sign that it was his.
							That way he could lend 
							it without the new reader forgetting who to give it back to.</p>
                        <br>

                        <div class="text-center">
                            <img src="img/Exlibrisenlibro.jpg" alt="Title">
                        </div>
                        <br><br>

                        <p>They were first used in the Middle Ages and had the form of a stamp, but they achieved popularity
						during the nineteenth century.</p><br>

                        <div class="text-center">
                            <img src="img/grupoexlibris.jpg" alt="Title">
                        </div>
                        <br><br>

                        <p>We wanted to incorporate that philosophy in our Seebooks, but adapting it to today´s world: our ExLib will also  
						 personalize your ebook, but with your “digital identity”, i.e. with your email address.</p>

                        <p>Our ExLibs have a practical function, an aesthetic experience, a wink and a game:
                            they serve to frame the serial number and the download code, but also to make our Seebooks prettier. Moreover, 
							as we want you to remember us, there will always be a fish in some part of the picture: in honour to "our" fish <img alt="Seebook fish" src="img/fish_red.png" width="45">. 
							The ExLibs are distributed randomly among our Seebooks. Till you open it, you will not know which one is 
							inside your card. All of this will make your card a unique copy you can collect.</p>

                        <p> Little by little we will order new Exlibs from designers and artists. Some of them will appear
						in limited editions of 100 or 1000 copies. We will announce the new drawings and promote 
						the works of our chosen artists in our social networks. From time to time we will carry out contests in fine arts 
						and designing schools to 
						award and post the winning picture in some of our Seebooks.  
                            <br><br><br>

                        <br>

                        <p> Do you run a fine art school and would like to organize a contest among your students?
                            Are you an artist or a designer with certain track record and you would like to form part of our project designing 
							an ExLib for us? If that´s the case, <a href="mailto:info@digitaltangible.com">contact us!</a>
                            If we like it, we will add it to our gallery of ExLibs and promote it throughout our social networks. </p>

                        <p>Remember, there is only one condition: the drawing must have a fish!</p>
