                        <br>

                        <p>The ExLib is our technological update of a classic element: the
                            <i>ex
                                libris</i>. Formerly, as books were valuable and expensive commodities, every good
                            reader had his
                            particular <i>ex
                                libris</i>
                            designed and printed with his name. He used to paste it in the first page of a book as a
                            sign that it was
                            his.
                            That way he could lend
                            it without the new reader forgetting who to give it back to.</p><br>

                        <br>


                        <p>Our ExLib is the picture you will see inside our Seebooks. It carries the serial number of
                            the card and the
                            codes
                            you will need to download the content. </p>

                        <p>We wanted to incorporate the original <i>ex libris </i>philosophy in our Seebooks, but
                            adapting them to today´s world:
                            our ExLib will
                            also
                            personalize your ebook, but with your “digital identity”, i.e. with your email address.
                        </p><br>


                        <div class="text-center">

                        </div>
                        <br>

                        <p> The ExLibs are distributed randomly among our Seebooks. Till you open it, you will not know
                            which one is
                            inside your card. And
                            as we want you to remember us, there will always be a fish in some part of the picture: in
                            honour to "our"
                            fish <img alt="Seebook fish" src="../img/fish_red.png" width="45">.</p>


                        <p> We order our Exlibs from designers and artists. We will announce the new drawings and
                            promote
                            the works of our chosen artists in our social networks. From time to time we will carry out
                            contests in fine
                            arts
                            and designing schools to
                            award and post the winning picture in some of our Seebooks.

                                Writing, drawing and taking photos are the ways I found to express myself and to live the art. A verse in a poem can generate in me the need to draw on paper with very fine markers;
                                then I take a picture of the finished work and I link it to a text. That's my creative process.
                                To fully understand one of my artworks, one needs to know the feeling that generated it; to know the whole journey, to be able to value the small parts in order to give a new meaning to the whole.
                                Art requires the commitment of getting closer in order to feel; because right there, on the sum of the smallest details, is where beauty lies."

                                 I've been through a lot of different jobs  (and hopefully I will go through many more, I do not like doing the same thing for more than 3 years).
                                 Since I'm basically  an imaginative person, I tend to reflect that on my work ... either in administration or teaching math.
                                 I spent many years in an academy learning almost every painting technique, from oil to watercolor, but lately I tend to give them a digital last touch.
                                 I prefer painting to drawing, but this past year I spend hours and hours drawing from life to improve myself. If you want to see some of those drawing, visit my page in facebook."
