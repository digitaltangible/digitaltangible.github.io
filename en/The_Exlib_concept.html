                        <br>

                        <p>Having a book in your hands is not only about accessing the content, it´s also an aesthetic
                            experience: we
                            value
                            a beautiful binding, the warmth of the paper and many other things that makes a book an
                            object with charm.
                            We would like
                            to keep part of that charm with our Seebooks. For technology not to make us give up the
                            beautiful arts a
                            book embodies, we have
                            created the ExLib concept.
                        </p>

                        <p>Our ExLib is the picture you will see inside our Seebooks. It carries the serial number of
                            the card and the
                            codes
                            you will need to download the content.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <div class="text-center">
                            <img src="../img/exlibdefconqr.jpg" alt="Title">
                        </div>
                        <br><br>

                        <p>It is a tribute to one of the classic elements of the bibliophile: <i>ex
                            libris </i>is a Latin phrase meaning 'from the books'. Formerly every good reader had his
                            particular ex
                            libris
                            designed and printed with his name. He used to paste it in the first page of a book as a
                            sign that it was
                            his.
                            That way he could lend
                            it without the new reader forgetting who to give it back to.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <div class="text-center">
                            <img src="../img/exlibris.jpg" alt="Title">
                        </div>
                        <br><br>


                        <p>We wanted to incorporate that philosophy in our Seebooks, but adapting it to today´s world:
                            our ExLib will
                            also
                            personalize your ebook, but with your “digital identity”, i.e. with your email address.
                        </p>

                        <p>Our ExLibs have a practical function, an aesthetic experience, a wink and a game:
                            they serve to frame the serial number and the download code, but also to make our Seebooks
                            prettier.
                            Moreover,
                            as we want you to remember us, there will always be a fish in some part of the picture: in
                            honour to "our"
                            fish <img alt="Seebook fish" src="../img/fish_red.png" width="45">.
                            The ExLibs are distributed randomly among our Seebooks. Till you open it, you will not know
                            which one is
                            inside your card. All of this will make your card a unique copy you can collect.
                        </p>

                        <p> Little by little we will order new Exlibs from designers and artists. Some of them will
                            appear
                            in limited editions of 100 or 1000 copies. We will announce the new drawings and promote
                            the works of our chosen artists in our social networks. From time to time we will carry out
                            contests in fine
                            arts
                            and designing schools to
                            award and post the winning picture in some of our Seebooks.

                            our project
                            designing

                            networks.
                        </p>

                        <p>Remember, there is only one condition: the drawing must have a fish!</p>

							McGuane worked for a month on the roof of a building in Barcelona, whose spectacular view inspired her 
							the gouaches that have given rise to this series of four Exlibs. We are very proud to inaugurate our 'Artists ExLibs' with them! 
							<br>Antonia has lived and worked in Nova Scotia (Canada) and Dublin (Ireland). Since 2010, Antonia has been working and exhibiting 
							in Spain as an artist in residence at Fundacion Valparaiso, Mojacar, Jiwar Creation & Society, Barcelona and Can Serrat Centro 
							de Actividades Artisticas, El Bruc. Some of her artwork is now part of the Can Serrat collection, 
							of the Ajuntament de Collbató, of the Canada Council Art Bank and of the Acadia University Art Gallery, Nova Scotia. 
							<br> Antonia was educated at the Vrije Academy of The Hague. She is the recipient of arts grants that support her work, in Canada and Ireland. 
							<br> You can see a sample of her artwork in her blog antoniamcguane.com."

                                Writing, drawing and taking photos are the ways I found to express myself and to live the art. A verse in a poem can generate in me the need to draw on paper with very fine markers;
                                then I take a picture of the finished work and I link it to a text. That's my creative process.
                                To fully understand one of my artworks, one needs to know the feeling that generated it; to know the whole journey, to be able to value the small parts in order to give a new meaning to the whole.
                                Art requires the commitment of getting closer in order to feel; because right there, on the sum of the smallest details, is where beauty lies."

                                 I've been through a lot of different jobs  (and hopefully I will go through many more, I do not like doing the same thing for more than 3 years).
                                 Since I'm basically  an imaginative person, I tend to reflect that on my work ... either in administration or teaching math.
                                 I spent many years in an academy learning almost every painting technique, from oil to watercolor, but lately I tend to give them a digital last touch.
                                 I prefer painting to drawing, but this past year I spend hours and hours drawing from life to improve myself. If you want to see some of those drawing, visit my page in facebook."
